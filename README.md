# Graduation-Project
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive weapon detection and alert system developed as part of my graduation project. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, the system utilizes YOLOv8 for real-time object detection, alongside OpenCV for image processing and PySide for the user interface.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Utilizes YOLOv8 for efficient and accurate weapon detection in live video feeds.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with PySide, providing an intuitive graphical user interface for easy interaction and monitoring.
Alert System: Configurable alert mechanisms to notify users when a weapon is detected.
Customizable Settings: Users can adjust detection parameters and alert preferences.
Detailed Logging: Maintains logs of detected events for analysis and review.
