# Graduation-Project
Overview This repository contains a comprehensive weapon detection and alert system developed as part of my graduation project. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, the system utilizes YOLOv8 for real-time object detection, alongside OpenCV for image processing and PySide for the user interface.
